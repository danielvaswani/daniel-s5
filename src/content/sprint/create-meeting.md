The current way users create meetings is slightly flawed in certain ways. 

For instance, it is apparent that, through stakeholder interview, users often forget to send out invites for the meeting until its far too late. This suggests that important information is not placed in front of the user as it should be. Furthermore, its important to know where invites getting sent.

Time and date of a meeting looks a little boring, it does the job, but people are found guessing the total meeting duration and the day of the week the meeting was happening. Through user testing, it was found out that users prefer to have sections in which the intent of the section would be boldly stated. Sliders offer more interaction.

Through user testing it was found that the mental model of creating a meeting for the specific user involves imagining the day of the week that they are most available. People have specific activities planned throughout the week but think of it on a daily perspective. And as such it makes sense to include the day of the week in the dialog.

Through thorough user research and expert interview it was concluded that the most common and meaningful time intervals for meetings are 15, 30, 60, 120 mins.

Through user testing it was concluded that the plan meeting button did not show enough intent. It is "just a big green button" that does not convey what it will do. 

It should say what is happening. More specifically, the amount of meetings you have chosen in the meeting reccurence fields should be present in the button, "Plan 3 meetings". But that is not all. The new button tells the user if invites will be sent out as well. 

If you have selected no attendees, it will tell you that no invites will be sent, but if you selected some, and also choose an integration to use, it will tell you precisely where the invites will go, solving the problem of the ominous green button.
