## Sub-questions
##### What is a functional meeting platform?

It helps you set a time and date and title for a meeting. Others can join the meeting and see the bare minimum, title and time.

##### What is a reliable meeting platform
Relatively free of bugs, users can rely on it to keep track, discuss, and store info in and around their meetings concerning their day to day work

##### What is a meaningful meeting platform?

There are a few things that makes a meeting SaaS meaningful. Value is shown in how the program decides to generate things for the user.
  
Another way it can be meaningful is to simplify what they do currently. For this tool all it required was having a cleaner UI / mental model translation than Microsoft Word in the context of managing meeting minutes.

A precursor for meaningful UX is having convenience. TopicalMeetings does that by saving people time and effort in copy and pasting.

They do not have to remember things like what time / members and agenda points their meetings usually have.
