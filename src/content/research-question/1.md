### Sub-questions

##### What is a functional meeting platform?

![UX Pyramid](/assets/research/UXPyramid.png)

It helps you set a time and date and title for a meeting. Others can join the meeting and see the bare minimum, title and time.

Important features to achieve this are:

-- Making buttons easily associated with the related function

-- Emphasizing the CTA

-- Using progress bars for multi-step processes

-- Adding sorting and filtering functions when they are needed

-- Authentication, Authorization, user data persistence

##### What is a reliable meeting platform

> Methods: [Prototyping](https://www.google.com) | [Literature Study](https://www.google.com) | [Expert Interview](https://www.google.com)

Features:

-- Availability and accuracy

-- Reliable and clean data

-- Responsive design, different component types are used strategically with input, user accesibility and screen size

-- Quality assurance

##### What is a meaningful, pleasurable, and convenient meeting tracking platform?

Through competitor analysis, I found features that are useful. Having atleast a subset of these is crucial in a meeting tracking software that offers meaningful experiences, they are:

-- Quick but thorough onboarding (Large focus of my internship)

-- 2-way Tightly coupled calendar integration (Research phase)

-- Live collaboration (Ongoing)

-- Meeting templates & powerful scheduling (Already in Topical)

-- Data visualization for your activity with insights

-- Useful prescriptions based on the type of user you are

### Conclusions

-- Usability & User testing is needed

-- Onboarding focus of internship

-- Advice to company; Data visualization & Insights and prescribe things to users

-- Research deliverable for 2-way calendar integration
