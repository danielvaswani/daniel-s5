### Sub-questions
##### What is a functional meeting platform?

It helps you set a time and date and title for a meeting. Others can join the meeting and see the bare minimum, title and time.

##### What is a reliable meeting platform
> Methods: [Prototyping](https://www.google.com) | [Literature Study](https://www.google.com) | [Expert Interview](https://www.google.com)

Relatively free of bugs, users can rely on it to keep track, discuss, and store info in and around their meetings concerning their day to day work

##### What is a meaningful meeting platform?

There are a few things that makes a meeting SaaS meaningful. Value is shown in how the program decides to generate things for the user.

A precursor for meaningful UX is having convenience. TopicalMeetings does that by saving people time and effort in copy and pasting.

They do not have to remember things like what time / members and agenda points their meetings usually have.
