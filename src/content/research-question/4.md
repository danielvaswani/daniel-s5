## Sub-questions

##### Are there any problems that arise from the way that its done currently?

-- Users forget to send out invites

-- Not interactive

-- Sections of form controls are not categorized or visually separated leading to users feeling overwhelmed.


##### What form controls will people understand the most effectively?

-- In the context of Time & Duration, a non-linear slider that has deliberate mark points at intervals users are most likely to make meetings for, is useful.

##### Do users want to create agenda points, location, a goal, and add members before the meeting has been created?
